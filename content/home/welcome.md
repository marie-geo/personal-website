Based on my education in engineering and robotics, I design textile-based wearable assistive robots for humans with mobility impairments. Throughout my PhD with Prof. Robert Riener at the Sensory-Motor Systems lab, ETH Zurich, I gained profound knowledge and experience in human anatomy and biomechanics, control for human-robot interactions, design and manufacturing of textile human-robot interfaces and validation of assistive robots.
