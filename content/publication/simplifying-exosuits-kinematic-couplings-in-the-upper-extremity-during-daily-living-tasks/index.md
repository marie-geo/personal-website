abstract: In the past few years, several light-weight soft wearable robots, so
  called exosuits, for upper extremity assistance have been developed. The
  design of exosuits is often based on a bio-mimetic design approach, mimicking
  the human biomechanics. However, in the design process, the interactions of
  movement directions during daily living tasks have not yet been analyzed
  comprehensively. Therefore, the designs of exosuits might be overly complex,
  as movement directions that are coupled during daily life tasks were
  implemented independently; or lack functionality, as relevant movement
  directions were disregarded. In the meta-analysis presented in this paper, the
  maximum angles occurring during daily living tasks in the upper extremity of
  unimpaired individuals were examined. To identify the kinematic couplings
  between joint axes, the interactions between movement directions that act
  against gravity were analyzed. The strongest correlations were found between
  rotation in the plane of elevation and humeral axial rotation (R 2 = 0.82, p
  <; 0.001), and between humeral elevation and humeral axial rotation (R 2 =
  0.16, p = 0.001). Shoulder rotations and elbow flexion were not correlated. We
  conclude that humeral axial rotation is a relevant movement direction in the
  upper extremity, which, so far, has often been neglected in the design of
  exosuits. To simplify the design of exosuits, we propose a one degree of
  freedom support trajectory in which rotation in the plane of elevation (at 70°
  and 80°) and humeral axial rotation (at 110° and 60°) are coupled to humeral
  elevation (continuously from 40° to 110°).
