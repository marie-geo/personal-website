abstract: "Soft wearable robots, or exosuits, area promising technology to
  assist the upper limb during daily life activities. So far, several exosuit
  concepts have been proposed, some of which were successfully tested in
  open-loop control. However, though simple and robust, open-loop control is
  cumbersome and unintuitive for use in daily life. Here, we closed the control
  loop on the human-robot interface of the Myoshirt. The Myoshirt is an upper
  limb exosuit that supports the shoulder joint during functional arm elevation.
  A direct three controller (DF) as well as an indirect farce controller (IF)
  were implemented on the Myoshirt to assess their suitability for autonomously
  tracking human movement. In a preceding testbench analysis, a direct force
  controller with linear friction compensation (DFF) could be excluded, as
  linearly compensating friction aggravated the force tracking error in the ramp
  response (RMSE mean|sd: 32.75|10.95 N) in comparison to the OF controller ramp
  response (27.61|9.38N). In the same analysis, the IF controller showed
  substantially better tracking performance (17.12|0.91). In the subsequent
  movement tracking analysis including five participants (one female), the
  position tracking error and smoothness (median(RMSI ), median(SPARC)) were
  similar with the DF (3.9°, -4.3) and lF (3.4°, -4.1) controllers and in an
  unpowered condition (3.7 , -4.2). However, the force tracking error and
  smoothness were substantially better when the IF controller (3.41,-4.5) was
  active than with the DF controller (10.4 N, -6.6). The magnitude response in
  the Bode analysis indicated that both controllers were obstructing the human
  movement at higher frequencies, however with 0.75 Hz, the IF controller
  satisfied the bandwidth requirement for daily life assistance, while the DF
  controller (0.83 Hz) did not. It can he concluded that the IF controller is
  most suitable for assisting human movement in daily life with the Myoshirt."

summary: "To find an intuitive way of human-robot interaction with the Myoshirt,
  we compared three different force control schemes: a direct force controller,
  a direct force controller with friction compensation, an indirect force
  controller."
