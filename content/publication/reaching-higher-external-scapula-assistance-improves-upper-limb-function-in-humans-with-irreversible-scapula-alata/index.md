title: "Reaching higher:  External scapula assistance can improve upper limb
  function in humans with irreversible scapula alata"
subtitle: In humans with scapula alata, an instability and protrusion of the
  shoulder blade during arm movement, therapist assistance of the scapula alone
  significantly increases shoulder elevation, an effect that could be partially
  replicated with a scapula orthosis.
abstract: Background

  Scapular dyskinesis, i.e., the deviant mobility or function of the scapula, hampers upper limb function in daily life. A typical sign of scapular dyskinesis is a scapula alata—a protrusion of the shoulder blade during arm elevation. While some reversible causes of scapula alata can be treated with therapy, other, irreversible causes require invasive surgical interventions. When surgery is not an option, however, severe limitations arise as standard approaches for assisting the scapula in daily life do not exist. The aim of this study was to quantify functional improvements when external, i.e., non-invasive, scapula assistance is provided.

  Methods

  The study was designed as a randomized controlled crossover trial. Eight participants with a scapula alata due to muscular dystrophy performed arm elevations in shoulder flexion and abduction while unassisted (baseline), externally assisted by a trained therapist, and externally assisted by a novel, textile-based scapula orthosis.

  Results

  With therapist assistance, average arm elevation increased by 17.3° in flexion (p < 0.001, 95% confidence interval of the mean CI95%=[9.8∘,24.9∘]), and by 11.2° in abduction (p < 0.01, CI95%=[4.7∘,17.7∘]), constituting the potential of external scapula assistance. With orthosis assistance, average arm elevation increased by 6.2° in flexion (CI95%=[0.4∘,11.9∘]) and by 5.8° in abduction (CI95%=[3.0∘,8.5∘]). Remarkably, in three participants, the orthosis was at least as effective as the therapist. Moreover, orthosis assistance reduced average perceived exertion by 1.25 points (Borg Scale) when elevating a filled bottle during a simulated daily living task.

  Conclusion

  These findings indicate a large potential for future advancements in orthotics. Already now, the textile-based scapula orthosis presented here is a feasible tool for leveraging the benefits of external scapula assistance when a therapist is unavailable, as encountered in daily life scenarios.
