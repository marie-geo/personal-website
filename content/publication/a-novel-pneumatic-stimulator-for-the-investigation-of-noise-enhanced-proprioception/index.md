abstract: Executing coordinated movements requires that motor and sensory
  systems cooperate to achieve a motor goal. Impairment of either system may
  lead to unstable and/or inaccurate movements. In rehabilitation training,
  however, most approaches have focused on the motor aspects of the control
  loop. We are examining mechanisms that may enhance the sensory system to
  improve motor control. More precisely, the effects of stochastic subliminal
  vibratory tactile stimulation on wrist proprioception. We developed a device -
  based on a novel soft pneumatic actuator skin technology - to stimulate
  multiple sites simultaneously and independently. This device applies vibratory
  stimulation (amplitude <; 0.50 mm, bandwidth 20-120 Hz) to the skin overlaying
  the tendons of a joint to target the receptors in charge of position and
  movement encoding. It achieves high spatial resolution (< 1 mm 2 ), uses a
  soft and flexible interface, and has the potential to be used in combination
  with additional rehabilitation interventions. We conducted a feasibility study
  with 16 healthy subjects (11 younger - 6 females; 5 older - 2 females) in
  which a robotic manipulandum moved the subject's wrist to defined positions
  that had to be matched with a gauge. Comparing trials with and without
  stimulation we found that stochastic stimulation influenced joint position
  sense. The device we developed can be readily used in psycho-physical
  experiments, and subsequently benefit physiotherapy and rehabilitation
  treatments.
