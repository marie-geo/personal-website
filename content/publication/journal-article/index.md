abstract: Stochastic stimulation has been shown to improve movement, balance,
  the sense of touch, and may also improve position sense. This stimulation can
  be non-invasive and may be a simple technology to enhance proprioception. In
  this study, we investigated whether sub-threshold stochastic tactile
  stimulation of mechanoreceptors reduces age-related errors in wrist position
  estimation. Fifteen young (24.5±1.5y) and 23 elderly (71.7±7.3y) unimpaired,
  right-handed adults completed a wrist position gauge-matching experiment. In
  each trial, the participant's concealed wrist was moved to a target position
  between 10 and 30° of wrist flexion or extension by a robotic manipulandum.
  The participant then estimated the wrist's position on a virtual gauge. During
  half of the trials, sub-threshold stochastic tactile stimulation was applied
  to the wrist muscle tendon areas. Stochastic stimulation did not significantly
  influence wrist position sense. In the elderly group, estimation errors
  decreased non-significantly when stimulation was applied compared to the
  trials without stimulation [mean constant error reduction Δμ=0.8° in flexion
  and Δμ=0.7° in extension direction, p = 0.95]. This effect was less pronounced
  in the young group [Δμ=0.2° in flexion and in extension direction, p = 0.99].
  These improvements did not yield a relevant effect size (Cohen's d < 0.1).
  Estimation errors increased with target angle magnitude in both movement
  directions. In young participants, estimation errors were non-symmetric, with
  estimations in flexion [μ=1.8°, σ=7.0°] being significantly more accurate than
  in extension [μ=8.3°, σ=9.3°, p < 0.01]. This asymmetry was not present in the
  elderly group, where estimations in flexion [μ=7.5°, σ=9.8°] were similar to
  extension [μ=7.7°, σ=9.3°]. Hence, young and elderly participants performed
  equally in extension direction, whereas wrist position sense in flexion
  direction deteriorated with age (p < 0.01). Though unimpaired elderly adults
  did not benefit from stochastic stimulation, it cannot be deduced that
  individuals with more severe impairments of their sensory system do not profit
  from this treatment. While the errors in estimating wrist position are
  symmetric in flexion and extension in elderly adults, young adults are more
  accurate when estimating wrist flexion, an effect that has not been described
  before.

summary: In this study, we showed how wrist position sense asymmetry changes
  with age, and how these changes are unaffected by stochastic tactile
  stimulation.
