abstract: Immobility due to movement impairments causes many secondary
  conditions that are a threat to a person's health and quality of life.
  Wearable robotic mobility aids such as exoskeletons and exosuits are a
  promising technique to tackle immobility. These devices are attached to the
  human with cuffs. However, the physical interaction at the human-robot
  interface is not yet well understood. Misplacement and compression of soft
  tissue diminish the efficiency of the robot and the comfort for the human. We
  developed a measurement method that allows us to simultaneously measure cuff
  interaction forces in normal and tangential direction. The measurement setup
  was validated in a friction test bench. The test-retest reliability was
  evaluated in an isolated attachment cuff mounted on a human forearm. Force
  measurements were repeatable, with error ranges up to 28.7% or 7.8 N in
  normal, 28.7% or 2.3 N in tangential direction. Our method is the first
  approach that simultaneously measures normal and tangential forces at the
  physical interface of wearable robots. The test-retest reliability is within
  the range of methods that assess only normal forces.
summary: "We developed and tested a method to quantify normal and shear forces in textile human-robot interfaces."
