I developed a device that can be used to provide tactile pneumatic stimulation using custom-made soft pneumatic actuators SPA. The SPA were manufactured by our collaborators Harshal Sonar and Jamie Paik from the Reconfigurable Robotics Lab (RRL) at EPF Lausanne.

The device was successfully employed in our study on wrist position sense in elderly and younger adults.
